				<p class="aboutbrianlau">
					I am Brian Lau, a developer living in Portland, Oregon. My family is from
					China and Hong Kong. I have an MBA and a BA from the University of Portland
					and the University of Washington, respectively. I like to play basketball,
					bring people together, and create things.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p class="year">1988</p>
				<p class="aboutbrianlau">
					My story with computers began in 1995 when our family got our first IBM Windows 95
					computer. It costed over $2000 and I vaguely remember deleting all the system files
					in an attempt to create more space. Since then, I've always been the go-to computer
					guy to fix things. Sometimes our failures have the adverse effect on us.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p class=year>2006</p>
				<p class="aboutbrianlau">
					I began college in Seattle at the University of Washington. Going to college there
					changed my perspective completely. I found an incredible group of friends, I was
					exposed to great ideas, and I struggled. Hard. I realized I coasted through high
					school and now, I was in a league with very bright people.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p class=year>2010</p>
				<p class="aboutbrianlau">
					I graduated and learned that my dad had lung cancer and about a year left to live.
					This was the true learning experience. I got my first job doing office work, was
					teaching Sunday School, taking a course at Portland State, and studying for the
					GMAT. I passed.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p class=year>2012</p>
				<p class="aboutbrianlau">
					Needing a change, I enrolled in a 6-month Chinese Language Program at Tsinghua
					University in Beijing, China - the one that Mark Zuckerberg speaks at. I felt very
					comfortable there as I was no longer a minority. I was also living the dream, I had
					always wanted to learn Chinese, and each day it felt like what I learned in class,
					I could later use in the day. Spring 2012 at Tsinghua was a very special time and
					a needed getaway. When I returned, I began my MBA program.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p class=year>2015</p>
				<p class="aboutbrianlau">
					After a short stint at Nike, I completed my MBA, and realized I wanted to code. I
					enrolled at Epicodus and did that. Along with meeting some really interesting people,
					I am really happy that I can now develop websites and applications. Let's see where
					the road goes next.
